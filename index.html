	<h2>Ahoora Vazifeh art sotry</h2>
	<p>I am Ahoora Vazifeh (Afsaneh), born in Iran.</p>

	<p>The artistic story of my life started when I decided to show my works in a more professional way and showed my first painting called Woman to the public and artists in Nidra Art Exhibition in Istanbul (Turkey).</p>

	<p>After that, my passion for painting increased, and the love and passion of my teenage years blossomed again in me, and I became more determined to paint.</p>

	<p>In the international exhibition ArtAnkara 2022 (Turkey), I participated with three paintings named Liberation, exhibiting my works alongside Iranian and foreign painters and artists.</p>

	<p>After a few months I participated with two works in the ArtContact International Exhibition in Istanbul (Turkey) and recorded sweet and beautiful experiences in my artistic portfolio.</p>

	<p>Now I've joined the digital world and will  continue my work, creating NFTs.</p>

	<p>I will be happy with dear friends and artists who accompany me on this path and support my works.</p>
	<p>
	Thank you,
	Ahoora
